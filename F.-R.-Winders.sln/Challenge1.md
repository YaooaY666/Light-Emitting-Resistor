## üîê Challenge One - The Locked Door

## Step 1: Web Challenge
After clicking the DOOR link, we viewed the page source to find the directory to the access log page by viewing the html code. We found it to be `/dwvdtoub` when looking at the styling for the disabled ‚ÄòAccess Log‚Äô button. This brings us to the access log page by appending `/dwvdtoub` to the webpage address. On the page, we found the first flag, which is `hackathon{butt0ns_4r3_c00l}`

Viewing page source once again, we found a hint to use SQL injection for the password, since this comment `<! ‚Äì remember to prevent sql injection ‚Äì >` was left in the line containing the text input for the password. Using SQL injection, we tried several options, such as `‚Äúadmin‚Äô OR 1=1 ‚Äì-‚Äù` and `‚Äúadmin‚Äô OR NULL IS NULL -- ‚Äú`, for which the latter worked. Here, the `WHERE` statement in the SQL query evaluates to `true`, as the username matches and even though the password is false, the condition `NULL IS NULL` is always true. We were thus able to download the .pcap file. Here, the second flag is found in the file name, which is `hackathon{sql_1nj3ct10n_1s_e4sy}`

## Step 2: Crypto Challenge
Using Wireshark, we opened the `.pcap` file and Followed the TCP stream, giving us information that the encryption protocol used is the RSA Algorithm, `n:197223219037565632376695983094276850131`, `e: 65537`, and `Ciphertext: 30481081274197412964612081780126987047`. A tip to use SageMathCell for the calculations was also given. Referring to the RSA Algorithm, our public key is `(n, e)` and the private key is `(n, d)`. The goal is then to find the original message `m`, where `m = c^d mod n`. To find `d`, we first factor `n`, a product of two primes, using SageMathCell to find its prime factors `p` and `q`, leading to `p = 10929942114895672009` and `q = 18044305904308822459`. Then we calculate phi(n), where phi is Euler's totient function, `phi_n = (p - 1) * (q - 1)`. We use this to find `d`. Using the extended Euclidean Algorithm, we then get `d = e^(-1) mod phi_n`, obtaining `d = 137869975082579792794582046336105786081`. Calculating the original message `m`, we get `m = c^d mod n = 60554078`, the code for the door. Unlocking the door using the code, we find the third and last flag to be `hackathon{rsa_1s_4w3s0m3}`.
